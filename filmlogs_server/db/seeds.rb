# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

print "seeding..."

# Slideshow.create(
#   encodedAddress: "38%20Upper%20Montagu%20Street%2C%20Westminster%20W1H%201LJ%2C%20United%20Kingdom",
#   date: "2019.12.25",
